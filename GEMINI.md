# GEMINI Project Context

This document provides an overview of the current directory to be used as context for future AI interactions.

## Directory Overview

This is a **non-code project** directory focused on preparing a conference presentation. The core content is based on a research paper about a data-driven system for personalizing academic curricula for engineering students.

The directory contains the source research papers and several markdown files that serve as planning documents, scripts, and visual guides for the presentation slides.

## Key Files

-   `v2_fiee.pdf`: **(Primary Source)** This is the accepted "Work in Progress" research paper titled "Data-Driven Adaptive Curriculum-Personalizing Academic Pathways for Enhanced Engineering Student Success." The presentation should be based on the content and results within this paper.

-   `v1_Adaptive_curriculum.pdf`: A previous, more theoretical, and rejected version of the paper. It is useful for understanding the evolution of the research and the key differences (i.e., the inclusion of concrete results) that led to the acceptance of v2.

-   `presentation_guide.md`: A meta-document containing detailed advice on how to structure and create an effective, visually-driven academic presentation. It covers core principles, use of visuals, and how to avoid common pitfalls like text-heavy slides.

-   `diagram_guides.md`: Contains text-based "ASCII art" drafts of the key diagrams that should be created for the presentation. This serves as a blueprint for the final graphics, covering concepts like the "leaky funnel" of student attrition, the system's feedback loop, and the input data sources.

-   `presentation_v1.md`: A slide-by-slide script for a presentation based on the *rejected* v1 paper. While not the primary document to use, it can be a source for some of the narrative and theoretical explanations.

## Usage

The primary purpose of this directory is to build a compelling conference presentation. The workflow is as follows:

1.  **Understand the Core Content:** Use `v2_fiee.pdf` as the ground truth for all claims, results, and figures.
2.  **Structure the Narrative:** Use `presentation_guide.md` to inform the overall story and structure of the slide deck.
3.  **Plan Visuals:** Use `diagram_guides.md` as a blueprint to create polished graphical assets (diagrams, charts) for the slides.
4.  **Develop a Script:** The markdown files can be used as a starting point for speaker notes.
